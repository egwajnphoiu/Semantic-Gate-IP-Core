**The Semantic Gate** is a hardware-accelerated monitor designed to bridge the **Semantic Gap** in Large Language Models. Unlike probabilistic software filters that rely on secondary referee AI models, this IP core enforces geometric constraints on embedding manifolds directly at the silicon level, providing a **Deterministic Killswitch** for hallucinations.

By moving from statistical guessing to **Manifold Integrity**, we provide a universal hardware root of trust for grounding AI outputs.

## ⚙️ How it Works
The core theory posits that valid logical transitions exist within a structured high-dimensional manifold. The Semantic Gate calculates the **Error Energy ($E$)** of an inference step using the **$L_{1}$ Norm (Manhattan Distance)**:

$$E=\sum_{i=1}^{VECTOR-DIM}|(\vec{A}_{i}+\vec{R}_{i})-\vec{V}_{i}|$$

**Example**: 

$$Vector(King) + Vector(Relation_{Gender}) \approx Vector(Queen)$$
* **PASS ✅**: Error Energy is low ($E < T$); the inference stays on the tracks of the high-dimensional surface.

**Example**: 

$$Vector(King) + Vector(Relation_{Gender}) \approx Vector(Toaster)$$
* **FAULT ❌**: Error Energy spikes ($E \gg T$); the output is geometrically disconnected, and the Semantic Gate triggers an immediate hardware killswitch.

The system includes a **Self-Calibration** state machine (WARMUP, CALIBRATION, ACTIVE) that learns the unique noise floor of any LLM to distinguish between acceptable model variance and genuine hallucinations.

## 📊 Proven Performance

The `semantic_gate_pipelined_axi_core.sv` was verified using `iverilog` to ensure cycle-accurate parity with the manifold math.

| Metric | Hardware Tier (Low-Dim) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vector Dimension** | 16 |
| **Total Cycles** | 100 |
| **Detections (Lies)** | 100/100 (100%) |
| **False Alarms** | 0/100 (0%) |
| **Status** | SUCCESS (Verified) |

**Technical Summary:**
* **Calibration**: The hardware successfully calculated a dynamic threshold ($T$) of **84256** based on the model's noise floor.
* **Performance**: The simulation reached `$finish` at **16097000 ps**, confirming the efficiency of the multi-stage pipelined accumulator.

The JavaScript engine was subjected to two distinct validation tiers to test both sensitivity and production-scale stability:

| Metric | Validation Tier (Low-Dim) | Production Tier (High-Dim) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vector Dimension** | 16 | **1536 (Industry Standard)** |
| **Detections (Lies)** | 100/100 (100%) | **1000/1000 (100%)** |
| **False Alarms** | 5/100 (5%) | **0/1000 (0%)** |
| **Status** | SUCCESS | **SUCCESS (High Precision)** |

**The Manifold Sparsity Hypothesis:** As dimensionality increases to industry standards ($DIM=1536$), the gap between grounded logic and hallucinations increases exponentially, allowing for a deterministic killswitch without sacrificing system availability.
